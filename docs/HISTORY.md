
# History

## Background

I have been prgramming with threads in native development for years....decades even.

And when I found out there were threads in web apps I though...
you need to make it more accessible.

And I thought of all the developers that were afraid of threads until many languages had TASK libraries.

They woudl submit a little code and it would be run in a thread.

So I thought I should do the same for Web Workers

The first version I wrote in requirejs format because that is what I was ramping up on.

My first version 
https://github.com/cbuteau/webjobs

My second version was an excuse to learn ES6 class format.
https://github.com/cbuteau/webjobs.es6

THis version will be to make a usable library in angular projects.

## The name TroubleMaker

I am a strong believer in naming things uniquely.
I try not to name things UserManager or LogicManager but use other words.

The orginal name was something.
JobStarter or something boring.

It's key method was called start.

Late one night when things started coming together and I was so overtired I was talking to myself.
I was saying "who is going to start" ...and my response was the TRoubleMaker is going to start.

and I HAD to rename the class.
