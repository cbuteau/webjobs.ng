## Background

I have been prgramming with threads in native development for years....decades even.

And when I found out there were threads in web apps I though...
you need to make it more accessible.

And I thought of all the developers that were afraid of threads until many languages had TASK libraries.

They woudl submit a little code and it would be run in a thread.

So I thought I should do the same for Web Workers

The first version I wrote in requirejs format because that is what I was ramping up on.
